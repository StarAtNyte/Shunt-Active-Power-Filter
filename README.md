Neural Network-Based Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF)
Overview
This project implements a Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF) using Neural Networks as a replacement for the conventional PI controller. The system is designed to mitigate harmonics in three-phase power systems by using instantaneous power theory (p-q theory) combined with intelligent control.
