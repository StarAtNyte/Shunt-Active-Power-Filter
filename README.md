## Overview
This project implements a **Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF)** using Neural Networks as a replacement for the conventional PI controller. The system is designed to mitigate harmonics in three-phase power systems by leveraging instantaneous power theory (p-q theory) combined with intelligent control.

## Features
- Neural Network controller replacing traditional PI controller
- Real-time harmonic compensation
- Dynamic load testing capability
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) measurement and analysis
- Based on instantaneous p-q theory
- Three-phase system implementation

## System Components

### Power Circuit

- PWM Generator
- DC Voltage Control

## Requirements
- **MATLAB/Simulink** (R2020b or newer)
- **Simulink Power Systems** toolbox
- **Deep Learning Toolbox**
- **Simscape Electrical**
